# Background Creator
Constantly running personal background creator and setter.

[My example background](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47730337/155809386-a9afae7b-76c8-4f01-8038-f09562349eda.png)


# About the project
After receiving my professional Python certificate from Google, I was on a mission to create a useful but simple program. I sometimes found myself asking what day of the week it was, so I decided to create a program to stop that. This was mostly a test of my skills but this will actually be useful for me.

# What this project gave me: 
  - More experience using pypi, pip, and libraries
  - A better understanding of the schedule library
  - Real world PIL/Pillow use
  - Deeper knowledge of file management with python and logging

# Prerequisites
- Pillow 9.0.1
- schedule 1.1.0!
